LogX
==============================

LogX is a modern AI system for performance analysis and anomaly detection based on log files

--------

LogX is based on following open source technologies
------------

- Python 3.7
- [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)
- [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/06_resources/02_architecture_overview.html)
why combine MLflow with Kedro ?
